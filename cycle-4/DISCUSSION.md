# Introduction
TBD

# Interest / Motivation
This project came out of my experiences in CSC 848 (Advanced Software Exploitation) and CSC-844 (Advanced Reverse Engineering). These classes got me into reverse engineering and kernel hacking.  In both classes, and since then, I have had to routinely virtualize or emulate firmware from device vendors. It always seemed more painful that it needed to be to firmware virtualized.  There were a series of routine steps that I had to do over and over again each time.  Not to mention never quite remembering all the commands for QEMU. Each time I would do this, there was a lot of googling to remember exactly how to compile the kernel for a target architecture, create a root filesystem, etc.

Thus this project focused on simplifying that work flow so that I could more quickly get to the firmware analysis or kernel hacking.  Now, I can get a system up and running with only a few minutes of active work.


# Three Main Ideas
The three main ideas for the project are as follows:

1. **Automation**: TBD. 

2. **Declarative Configuration**: TBD.

3. **Firmware Emulation and Kernel Hacking**: TBD.


# Future Directions
TBD:

  * **Support Different Compilers**: TBD.
  * **Support Different CPU Architectures**: TBD.
  * **Additional Filesystem Modules**: TBD.
